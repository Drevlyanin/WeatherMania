Telegram bot providing weather info for cities via OpenWeatherMap API. Developed in Python using Telebot library. Easily customizable for new features and API integration

This is a simple weather bot for Telegram that provides users with the current temperature and weather conditions for a specified city. The bot uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data.

Installation
To use the bot, you first need to have a Telegram account and create a bot. Once you have created a bot, copy the bot token and replace the placeholder in the code with your bot token.

You also need to install the telebot and requests libraries using pip:

pip install telebot requests

Usage
To start using the bot, simply send the /start command to the bot. The bot will reply with a welcome message and instructions on how to get the weather for a city.

To get the weather for a city, use the /weather command followed by the name of the city. For example, to get the weather for New York, you would send the following command:

/weather New York

The bot will then retrieve the weather data for the specified city and send a message with the current temperature and weather conditions.

If the bot is unable to retrieve the weather data for a city, it will send an error message asking the user to try again.
